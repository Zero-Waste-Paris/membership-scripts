====== Install the dependencies ======

After having generated the php bundle, run from this directory:

    composer require zero-waste-paris/membership-scripts:dev-master


====== Setup a local conf ======

    cp .env .env.local

then override the values want

====== Create the database ======
To create the database (it will be a sqlite one in debug) run from this directory:

    php bin/console doctrine:database:create

and then, to create the schema:

    php bin/console doctrine:migrations:migrate

and then, to initialize a value for the last successful run date:

    php bin/console doctrine:database:initialize-last-successful-run-date 2022-01-01

(or whatever date would make sense).

for more info about how the database ORM and its integration works, see:
https://symfony.com/doc/current/doctrine.html

====== Setting up the Google API ======
It's a bit of a pain to build API keys.
As a ZWP dev the easiest is perhaps to fetch the one we have in prod.

FTR, here is the former doc we had (to have some clues in case we ever need to generate a new credentials file,
but it seems that part of this doc may be obsolete):

> From your Google Suite admin account (be sure to use this account!):
>
> - Enable the Directory API https://developers.google.com/admin-sdk/directory/v1/quickstart/php 
>   (click on _Enable the directory API_)
> - Download the `credentials.json` that are generated after this and save them at the root
>   of this folder
> - Generate the token by running `php generate_token.php`

(FWIW: here is what seems to be an up to date doc: https://developers.google.com/workspace/guides/get-started )

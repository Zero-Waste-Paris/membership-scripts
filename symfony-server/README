====== Install the dependencies ======

After having generated the php bundle, run from this directory:

    composer require zero-waste-paris/membership-scripts:dev-master


====== Setup a local conf ======

    cp .env .env.local

then override the values want

====== Create the database ======
To create the database (it will be a sqlite one in debug) run from this directory:

    php bin/console doctrine:database:create

and then, to create the schema:

    php bin/console doctrine:migrations:migrate

and then, to initialize a value for the last successful run date:

    php bin/console doctrine:database:initialize-last-successful-run-date 2022-01-01

(or whatever date would make sense).
